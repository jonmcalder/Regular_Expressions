- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will look at the use of character classes in regular 
    expressions. These are convenient character categories which allow one to 
    easily match words, spaces, digits etc.
    
- Class: text
  Output: There are actually two flavors of character classes. One uses '[:' and
    ':]' around a predefined name inside square brackets and the other uses '\' 
    along with a special character. In many cases these are interchangeable as 
    we'll soon see.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can indicate a digit character with '[:digit:]' (or alternatively 
    with '\d'). We have created a vector of alphanumeric characters in the 
    'passwords' object. Use grepl to check which of these passwords contain 
    digits.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(pattern = '[:digit:]', x = passwords)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grepl(pattern = '[:digit:]', x = passwords)")
    # include '\d' answer variant?
  Hint: Simply use grepl with pattern = '[:digit:]'

# Escaped character classes not working in swirl?
#- Class: cmd_question
#  Output: You can indicate a non-digit character with '\D'. Use grepl to check 
#    which of these passwords start with a non-digit character.
#  CorrectAnswer: grepl(pattern = '^\\D', x = passwords)
#  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grepl(pattern = '^\\D', x = passwords)")
#  Hint: Simply use grepl with a pattern which combines the 'starts with' anchor 
#    ('^') with '\\D'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can match any lower-case letter character with '[:lower:]'. Use 
    grepl to check which of the passwords contain a lower-case character.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(pattern = '[:lower:]', x = passwords)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grepl(pattern = '[:lower:]', x = passwords)")
  Hint: pattern = '[:lower:]'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next try and check which of the passwords begin with a lower-case 
    character.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(pattern = '^[:lower:]', x = passwords)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grepl(pattern = '^[:lower:]', x = passwords)")
  Hint: Remember the '^' anchor from the previous lesson? Simply combine '^' 
    and '[:lower:]' in the regex pattern.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can match any upper-case letter character with '[:upper:]'. Use 
    grepl to check which of the passwords contain an upper-case character.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(pattern = '[:upper:]', x = passwords)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grepl(pattern = '[:upper:]', x = passwords)")
  Hint: pattern = '[:upper:]'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now check which of the passwords end with an upper-case character.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(pattern = '[:upper:]$', x = passwords)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grepl(pattern = '[:upper:]$', x = passwords)")
  Hint: Simply combine '$' and '[:upper:]' in the regex pattern.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The pattern '[:alpha:]' will match any alphabetic characters (lower or
    upper-case), and is thus equivalent to '[[:lower:][:upper:]]', or 
    '[[A-Z][a-z]]'.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Note that in order to combine (union) character classes of the form 
    '[:...:]' within a pattern they need to be enclosed in square brackets e.g. 
    '[[:lower:][:upper:]]' as above. Patterns like '[a-z]' however can be combined 
    together without additional square brackets, so that '[[A-Z][0-9]]' and 
    '[A-Z0-9]' are equivalent. By contrast '[A-Z][0-9]' is not equivalent to 
    these since it is a two character pattern.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: The pattern '[:alnum:]' matches any alphanumeric characters - in other 
    words alphabetic characters plus digit characters. Which of the below patterns
    is equivalent to '[:alnum:]'?
  AnswerChoices: pattern = '[[:alpha:][:digit:]]'; pattern = '[:alpha:][:digit:]';
    pattern = '[:alpha:][0-9]'; pattern = '[[a-z][0-9]]'
  CorrectAnswer: pattern = '[[:alpha:][:digit:]]'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "pattern = '[[:alpha:][:digit:]]'")
  Hint: Remember we need both upper and lower case characters as well as digits, 
    and these need to be combined into a single character pattern.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Another equivalent expression for '[:alnum:]' is '[A-z0-9]'. This relies
    on the use of '[A-z]' in place of '[[A-Z][a-z]]'.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: The expression '[:xdigit:]' can be used to match hexadecimal digits 
    i.e. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f. Which of the below 
    patterns is equivalent to '[:xdigit:]'?
  AnswerChoices: pattern = '[A-F0-9a-f]'; pattern = '[[0-9][a-f]]'; 
    pattern = '[[:alpha:][0-9]]'; pattern = '[[0-9][A-F]]'
  CorrectAnswer: pattern = '[A-F0-9a-f]'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "pattern = '[A-F0-9a-f]'")
  Hint: Remember that in addition to digits 0 through 9, hexadecimal digits 
    include both the upper and lower-case letters a through f.
  
- Class: text
  Output: In the next lesson, we'll explore the use of groups and ranges in 
    regular expressions. By investigating these we will start to explore how 
    different pattern concepts can be mixed together to build more complex 
    expressions.
